  //    `gcloud auth application-default login`.  This is preferred for local

All entries deleted and hidden since the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not allowed to set showDeleted neither showHidden to False. To ensure client state consistency minAccessRole query parameter cannot be specified together with nextSyncToken. If the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken. Learn more about incremental synchronization. Optional. The default is to return all entries.
