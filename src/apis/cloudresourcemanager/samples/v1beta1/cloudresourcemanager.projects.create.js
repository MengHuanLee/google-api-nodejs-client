 * Creates a Project resource.
 *
 * Initially, the Project resource is owned by its creator exclusively.
 * The creator can later grant permission to others to read or update the
 * Project.
 *
 * Several APIs are activated automatically for the Project, including
 * Google Cloud Storage. The parent is identified by a specified
 * ResourceId, which must include both an ID and a type, such as
 * project, folder, or organization.
 *
 * This method does not associate the new project with a billing account.
 * You can set or update the billing account associated with a project using
 * the [`projects.updateBillingInfo`]
 * (/billing/reference/rest/v1/projects/updateBillingInfo) method.

  //    Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Run, etc
  // 3. A local OAuth token written by the Cloud SDK, obtained by running
