The filter syntax is the same as described in [Stackdriver's Advanced Logs Filters](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters).  Sample filter "state: PAUSED".  Note that using filters might cause fewer queues than the requested page_size to be returned.

    // A token identifying the page of results to return.  To request the first page results, page_token must be empty. To request the next page of results, page_token must be the value of next_page_token returned from the previous call to ListQueues method. It is an error to switch the value of the filter while iterating through pages.
