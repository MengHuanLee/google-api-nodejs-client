  // 2. A GCE metadata server, present in Google Cloud products like
  //    Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Run, etc

  //    `gcloud auth application-default login`.  This is preferred for local

    endTime: 'placeholder-value',
    // Optional. A filter against labels for the request.  By default, searches use prefix matching. To specify exact match, prepend a plus symbol (`+`) to the search term. Multiple terms are ANDed. Syntax:  *   `root:NAME_PREFIX` or `NAME_PREFIX`: Return traces where any root     span starts with `NAME_PREFIX`. *   `+root:NAME` or `+NAME`: Return traces where any root span's name is     exactly `NAME`. *   `span:NAME_PREFIX`: Return traces where any span starts with     `NAME_PREFIX`. *   `+span:NAME`: Return traces where any span's name is exactly     `NAME`. *   `latency:DURATION`: Return traces whose overall latency is     greater or equal to than `DURATION`. Accepted units are nanoseconds     (`ns`), milliseconds (`ms`), and seconds (`s`). Default is `ms`. For     example, `latency:24ms` returns traces whose overall latency     is greater than or equal to 24 milliseconds. *   `label:LABEL_KEY`: Return all traces containing the specified     label key (exact match, case-sensitive) regardless of the key:value     pair's value (including empty values). *   `LABEL_KEY:VALUE_PREFIX`: Return all traces containing the specified     label key (exact match, case-sensitive) whose value starts with     `VALUE_PREFIX`. Both a key and a value must be specified. *   `+LABEL_KEY:VALUE`: Return all traces containing a key:value pair     exactly matching the specified text. Both a key and a value must be     specified. *   `method:VALUE`: Equivalent to `/http/method:VALUE`. *   `url:VALUE`: Equivalent to `/http/url:VALUE`.
    filter: 'placeholder-value',
    // Optional. Field used to sort the returned traces. Can be one of the following:  *   `trace_id` *   `name` (`name` field of root span in the trace) *   `duration` (difference between `end_time` and `start_time` fields of      the root span) *   `start` (`start_time` field of the root span)  Descending order can be specified by appending `desc` to the sort field (for example, `name desc`).  Only one sort field is permitted.
    orderBy: 'placeholder-value',
    // Optional. Maximum number of traces to return. If not specified or <= 0, the implementation selects a reasonable value.  The implementation may return fewer traces than the requested page size.
    pageSize: 'placeholder-value',
    // Token identifying the page of results to return. If provided, use the value of the `next_page_token` field from a previous request.
    pageToken: 'placeholder-value',
    // Required. ID of the Cloud project where the trace data is stored.
    projectId: 'placeholder-value',
    // Start of the time interval (inclusive) during which the trace data was collected from the application.
    startTime: 'placeholder-value',
    // Optional. Type of data returned for traces in the list. Default is `MINIMAL`.
