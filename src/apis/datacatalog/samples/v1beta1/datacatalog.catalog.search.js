 * Searches Data Catalog for multiple resources like entries, tags that

 * This is a custom method
 * (https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/custom_methods) and does not return
 * the complete resource, only the resource identifier and high level
 * fields. Clients can subsequentally call `Get` methods.

 * Note that Data Catalog search queries do not guarantee full recall. Query
 * results that match your query may not be returned, even in subsequent
 * result pages. Also note that results returned (and not returned) can vary
 * across repeated search queries.

  //    Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Run, etc
  // 3. A local OAuth token written by the Cloud SDK, obtained by running
  //    `gcloud auth application-default login`.  This is preferred for local
