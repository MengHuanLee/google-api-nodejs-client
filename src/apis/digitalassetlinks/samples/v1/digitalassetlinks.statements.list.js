/*
 * Retrieves a list of all statements from a given source that match the
 * specified target and statement string.
 *
 * The API guarantees that all statements with secure source assets, such as
 * HTTPS websites or Android apps, have been made in a secure way by the owner
 * of those assets, as described in the [Digital Asset Links technical design
 * specification](https://github.com/google/digitalassetlinks/blob/master/well-known/details.md).
 * Specifically, you should consider that for insecure websites (that is,
 * where the URL starts with `http://` instead of `https://`), this guarantee
 * cannot be made.
 *
 * The `List` command is most useful in cases where the API client wants to
 * know all the ways in which two assets are related, or enumerate all the
 * relationships from a particular source asset.  Example: a feature that
 * helps users navigate to related items.  When a mobile app is running on a
 * device, the feature would make it easy to navigate to the corresponding web
 * site or Google+ profile.

  //    Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Run, etc

  //    `gcloud auth application-default login`.  This is preferred for local

From the PEM  certificate, it can be acquired like this:      $ keytool -printcert -file $CERTFILE | grep SHA256:     SHA256: 14:6D:E9:83:C5:73:06:50:D8:EE:B9:95:2F:34:FC:64:16:A0:83: \         42:E6:1D:BE:A8:8A:04:96:B2:3F:CF:44:E5  or like this:      $ openssl x509 -in $CERTFILE -noout -fingerprint -sha256     SHA256 Fingerprint=14:6D:E9:83:C5:73:06:50:D8:EE:B9:95:2F:34:FC:64: \         16:A0:83:42:E6:1D:BE:A8:8A:04:96:B2:3F:CF:44:E5  In this example, the contents of this field would be `14:6D:E9:83:C5:73: 06:50:D8:EE:B9:95:2F:34:FC:64:16:A0:83:42:E6:1D:BE:A8:8A:04:96:B2:3F:CF: 44:E5`.  If these tools are not available to you, you can convert the PEM certificate into the DER format, compute the SHA-256 hash of that string and represent the result as a hexstring (that is, uppercase hexadecimal representations of each octet, separated by colons).

    // Web assets are identified by a URL that contains only the scheme, hostname and port parts.  The format is      http[s]://<hostname>[:<port>]  Hostnames must be fully qualified: they must end in a single period ("`.`").  Only the schemes "http" and "https" are currently allowed.  Port numbers are given as a decimal number, and they must be omitted if the standard port numbers are used: 80 for http and 443 for https.  We call this limited URL the "site".  All URLs that share the same scheme, hostname and port are considered to be a part of the site and thus belong to the web asset.  Example: the asset with the site `https://www.google.com` contains all these URLs:    *   `https://www.google.com/`   *   `https://www.google.com:443/`   *   `https://www.google.com/foo`   *   `https://www.google.com/foo?bar`   *   `https://www.google.com/foo#bar`   *   `https://user@password:www.google.com/`  But it does not contain these URLs:    *   `http://www.google.com/`       (wrong scheme)   *   `https://google.com/`          (hostname does not match)   *   `https://www.google.com:444/`  (port does not match) REQUIRED
