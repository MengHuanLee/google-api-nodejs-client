  //    Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Run, etc

Example 1: A filter of 'name=prod*' might return `Release`s with names within 'projects/foo' prefixed with 'prod':  Name                          | Ruleset Name ------------------------------|------------- projects/foo/releases/prod    | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid1234 projects/foo/releases/prod/v1 | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid1234 projects/foo/releases/prod/v2 | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid8888  Example 2: A filter of `name=prod* ruleset_name=uuid1234` would return only `Release` instances for 'projects/foo' with names prefixed with 'prod' referring to the same `Ruleset` name of 'uuid1234':  Name                          | Ruleset Name ------------------------------|------------- projects/foo/releases/prod    | projects/foo/rulesets/1234 projects/foo/releases/prod/v1 | projects/foo/rulesets/1234  In the examples, the filter parameters refer to the search filters are relative to the project. Fully qualified prefixed may also be used. e.g. `test_suite_name=projects/foo/testsuites/uuid1`
    filter: 'placeholder-value',
    // Resource name for the project.  Format: `projects/{project_id}`
    name: 'projects/my-project',
    // Page size to load. Maximum of 100. Defaults to 10. Note: `page_size` is just a hint and the service may choose to load fewer than `page_size` results due to the size of the output. To traverse all of the releases, the caller should iterate until the `page_token` on the response is empty.
    pageSize: 'placeholder-value',
    // Next page token for the next batch of `Release` instances.
    pageToken: 'placeholder-value',
