In v2alpha1, the following filter fields are supported&#58;  * createTime&#58; The time this job was created * events&#58; The set of event (names) that have occurred while running   the pipeline.  The &#58; operator can be used to determine if a   particular event has occurred. * error&#58; If the pipeline is running, this value is NULL.  Once the   pipeline finishes, the value is the standard Google error code. * labels.key or labels."key with space" where key is a label key. * done&#58; If the pipeline is running, this value is false. Once the   pipeline finishes, the value is true.  In v1 and v1alpha2, the following filter fields are supported&#58;  * projectId&#58; Required. Corresponds to   OperationMetadata.projectId. * createTime&#58; The time this job was created, in seconds from the   [epoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). Can use `>=` and/or `<=`   operators. * status&#58; Can be `RUNNING`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `CANCELED`. Only   one status may be specified. * labels.key where key is a label key.  Examples&#58;  * `projectId = my-project AND createTime >= 1432140000` * `projectId = my-project AND createTime >= 1432140000 AND createTime <= 1432150000 AND status = RUNNING` * `projectId = my-project AND labels.color = *` * `projectId = my-project AND labels.color = red`
