/*
 * If a resource is found based on the search criteria specified in the query
 * parameters, updates part of that resource by applying the operations
 * specified in a [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/) document.
 *
 * Implements the FHIR standard conditional patch interaction
 * ([STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#patch),
 * [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#patch)).
 *
 * DSTU2 doesn't define a conditional patch method, but the server supports it
 * in the same way it supports STU3.
 *
 * Search terms are provided as query parameters following the same pattern as
 * the search method.
 *
 * If the search criteria identify more than one match, the request will
 * return a `412 Precondition Failed` error.
 *
 * The request body must contain a JSON Patch document, and the request
 * headers must contain `Content-Type: application/json-patch+json`.
 *
 * On success, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation
 * of the updated resource, including the server-assigned version ID.
 * Errors generated by the FHIR store will contain a JSON-encoded
 * `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
 * request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
 * GCP error might be returned instead.
