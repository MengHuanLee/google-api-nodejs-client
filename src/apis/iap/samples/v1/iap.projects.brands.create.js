 * under it only accept requests from users who belong to the same G Suite
 * organization as the project. The brand is created in an un-reviewed status.
 * NOTE: The "internal only" status can be manually changed in the Google
 * Cloud console. Requires that a brand does not already exist for the
 * project, and that the specified support email is owned by the caller.
