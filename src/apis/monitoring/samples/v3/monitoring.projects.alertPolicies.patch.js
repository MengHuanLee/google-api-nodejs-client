The format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/alertPolicies/[ALERT_POLICY_ID] [ALERT_POLICY_ID] is assigned by Stackdriver Monitoring when the policy is created.

If this field is not empty, each listed field in the existing alerting policy is set to the value of the corresponding field in the supplied policy (alert_policy), or to the field's default value if the field is not in the supplied alerting policy. Fields not listed retain their previous value.Examples of valid field masks include display_name, documentation, documentation.content, documentation.mime_type, user_labels, user_label.nameofkey, enabled, conditions, combiner, etc.If this field is empty, then the supplied alerting policy replaces the existing policy. It is the same as deleting the existing policy and adding the supplied policy, except for the following: The new policy will have the same [ALERT_POLICY_ID] as the former policy. This gives you continuity with the former policy in your notifications and incidents. Conditions in the new policy will keep their former [CONDITION_ID] if the supplied condition includes the name field with that [CONDITION_ID]. If the supplied condition omits the name field, then a new [CONDITION_ID] is created.
