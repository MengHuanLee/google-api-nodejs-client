 * For service producers, provisions a new subnet in a peered service's shared

 * expressed as a CIDR range (number of leading bits of ipV4 network mask).
 * The method checks against the assigned allocated ranges to find a
 * non-conflicting IP address range. The method will reuse a subnet if
 * subsequent calls contain the same subnet name, region, and prefix length.
 * This method will make producer's tenant project to be a shared VPC service
 * project as needed.
